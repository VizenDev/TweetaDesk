Russ: Ordinary confidence does not translate to extraordinary results. So before you try and shoot someone's confidence down, try to shoot urs UP

Russ: However, what the majority of the world fails to realize is that in order to do extraordinary things u have to have extraordinary confidence

Russ: The majority of the world wants you to be docile in demeanor because unbelievable self confidence offends them due to their own lack of it..

Russ: You are the universe experiencing itself. Anything and everything is possible. Get in tune. Stay aware.

Russ: Confidence intimidates and offends people who are not confident. Once again, that is their problem they have to deal with. Not yours.

Russ: Let the world go and watch it all come to you....or fight it to the end and watch what it does to you.....

Russ: Stop comparing yourself to other people. They will always outnumber you. You're the only you in the world and that's power and beauty

Russ: A lotta insecure people get uncomfortable and offended when you display confident and secure behaviors. That's not your fault. That's theirs

Russ: Your imagination is only limited by your confidence and ambition. We all die. Do your shit.

Russ: You HAVE to believe in yourself. You can have the world believe in you, but if you don't believe in yourself, the world will not be enough

Russ: If you never start reaching, how will success ever be in your reach?

Russ: You only fail if you quit

Roman Atwood: WELL... Here it is! My poor kid blew out his teeth. Thanks for all the support!! https://t.co/hlmgaaFuDv

Hilarious Roasts™: This is dope 🙏 https://t.co/T9HMejLcKN

Russ: Love to everyone. Consistent quality is what's gotten me here. Quantity AND quality. I appreciate the love of the real fans. 🙏🏻♥️🙏🏻♥️🙏🏻♥️🙏🏻

Russ: I'm loggin off Twitter. Some of y'all are slow.  https://t.co/qDCNuHK1ZU

Russ: I love when people get offended. That means you stood up for your truth. Don't be scared. The truth hurts but will set you free.

Russ: Some of y'all gotta do research before talkin to me. I really studied this shit. This is my life.

Russ: This game is in trouble. I'm getting on at 23/24 not 17 when my skills weren't refined. I'm coming thru and fucking shit way up. I luv all u

Russ: I really put in the time and energy. If you have a passion, follow it wherever it takes you and lose yourself in it. It'll all pay off.

Russ: Name me one person in hip hop who has put out over 300 songs that they produced, wrote, performed, engineered, mixed &amp; mastered 

I'll wait

Russ: This isn't overnight. This isn't some fluke. This is 10,000+ hours.

Russ: Anything I get, I deserve and worked for. I dropped 11 albums self produced mixed engineer mastered before I even got a Soundcloud.

Russ: I use the money that I make now to change realities. In turn the universe is constantly changing mine. Give what you get.

Russ: Imma get to where I wanna get to because I said so and I'm self sufficient and have amazing real fans that multiply everyday

Russ: Engulf yourself in the idea of limitless possibilities

Russ: I was BROKE 8 months ago financially. But I was never broke mentally or spiritually. That's the key. The money will come.

Russ: Stay focused and stay believing in yourself. Life can change very quick.

Russ: I use to spam blogs and websites to post my music cuz I wanted to be presented on their platform. Now my platform is bigger than theirs.

Russ: You don't have to wait for the world to give you what you deserve. You can take it.

Russ: Just know, I'm playing chess. Everything is very calculated and done on purpose. Epic things being planned as we speak.

Russ: 35,000,000 total plays on soundcloud now and it goes up 2 million every week and it's all due to consistent quality and amazing real fans

Russ: A lot can happen in a year if you choose to take control of your present and dictate your future by doing so

Russ: I had barely 1000 followers on all social media platforms and less than 100 on soundcloud when I started dropping songs every week last year

Russ: Consistent quality is all it takes. Good music and truth can only be ignored for so long.

Russ: I'm laying the blueprint for going from obscurity and complete unknown to organic fan base, real numbers, and all the labels calling
